# Calculus-and-Music-
This project explores the fascinating relationship between calculus and music. It delves into how mathematical principles, such as derivatives and integrals, can be used to model sound waves, analyze harmonics, and study the behavior of musical tones.
Applications include:
Waveform Analysis: Understanding sound waves using sine and cosine functions.
Fourier Series: Decomposing complex musical signals into simpler components.
Frequency Modulation: Exploring how calculus helps in synthesizing and transforming sounds.


Through mathematical modeling and computational tools, this project bridges the gap between abstract mathematics and the art of music.
